### Gravity Game

A Javascript game I used to try out Webpack. Add planets and watch them interact via gravitational force. [Give it a try](https://cpaika.github.io/gravity-game/) and see if you can get a stable orbit!

### Local Development
1.  You need nvm installed.  On Mac OS you can install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install nvm
```
2.  Set the correct node version: `nvm use`
3.  Open the game in your browser: `open index.html`
4.  Run the webpack server: `npm run work`

Now you're good to develop, have fun!
